    <h3 id="headline">Tribute to the Greatest Manager of all time:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1941</strong> - Born on the 31<sup>st</sup> December, 1941 in small town in Glasgow called Govan</li>
  <li> <strong>1957 - 1970</strong> - Playing Career; Ferguson played as a striker, started his career as an amateur with Queen's Park, at aged 16. He then moved to St Johnstone in 1960. where he was on a part-time contract with St Johnstone, Ferguson became a full-time professional footballer in the 1964 - 1965 season with Dunfermline. Ferguson then joined Rangers for £65,000, which was a record fee for a transfer between two Scottish clubs. He eventually finished his playing career at Ayr United.</li>
  <li><strong>1974</strong> - In June 1974, Ferguson was appointed manager of East Stirlingshire, at the comparatively young age of 32.</li>
  <li><strong>1974</strong> - The following October, Ferguson was invited to manage St Mirren. While they were below East Stirlingshire in the league, they were a bigger club and although Ferguson felt a degree of loyalty towards East Stirlingshire, he decided to join St Mirren after taking advice from Jock Stein. Ferguson was manager of St Mirren from 1974 until 1978, producing a remarkable transformation of a team.</li>
    <li><strong>1978</strong> - In june 1978 Ferguson joined Aberdeen as manager. The season did not go especially well, with Aberdeen reaching the semi-final of the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup Final, but losing both matches and finishing fourth in the league.</li> 
    <li><strong>1979</strong> - Aberdeen had started the 1979–80 season poorly but their form improved dramatically in the new year and they won the Scottish league that season with a 5–0 win on the final day. It was the first time in 15 years that the league had not been won by either Rangers or Celtic. He was still a strict disciplinarian, though, and his players nicknamed him "Furious Fergie". He was dissatisfied with the atmosphere at Aberdeen matches, and deliberately created a "siege mentality" by accusing the Scottish media of being biased towards the Glasgow clubs, to motivate the team. #GOAT</li>
    <li><strong>1982</strong> - Aberdeen continued their success with a Scottish Cup win in 1982. Ferguson was offered the manager's job at Wolverhampton Wanderers but turned it down as he felt that Wolves were in trouble and his "ambitions at Aberdeen were not even half fulfilled".</li>
      <li><strong>1983</strong> - Ferguson led Aberdeen to even greater success the following season by qualifying for the European Cup Winners' Cup as a result of winning the Scottish Cup the previous season, and impressively knocked out Bayern Munich. This gave them the confidence to believe that they could go on to win the competition, which they did, with a 2–1 victory over Real Madrid in the final on 11 May 1983. Aberdeen became only the third Scottish team to win a European trophy and Ferguson now felt that "he'd done something worthwhile with his life". his was followed up with victory in the European Super Cup in December 1983, when Hamburger SV, the reigning European Cup champions, were beaten 2–0 over two legs.</li>
      <li><strong>1984</strong> - Arbedeen went on to win the scottish league despite a slow start, as well as retaining the Scottish Cup</li>
      <li><strong>1985</strong> - Ferguson was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1985 New Year Honours. </li>
      <li><strong>1986</strong> - Aberdeen won both domestic cups, but finished fourth in the league. Ferguson had been appointed to the club's board of directors early in 1986, but that April he told Dick Donald, their chairman, that he intended to leave that summer. Ferguson was appointed manager at Old Trafford on 6 November 1986. </li>
      <li><strong>1987</strong> - Ferguson finished his first season with Manchester United at 11th place. </li>
      <li><strong>1988</strong> - Ferguson made several major signings, including Steve Bruce, Viv Anderson, Brian McClair and Jim Leighton. The new players made a positive contribution to a United team who finished in second place, nine points behind Liverpool. </li>
      <li><strong>1990</strong> - Ferguson won his trophty with United. United won the FA Cup by beating Crystal Palace 1–0 in the final replay after a 3–3 draw in the first match. </li>
      <li><strong>1992</strong> - The 1991–92 season did not live up to Ferguson's expectations. United eventually won the League Cup and European Super Cup; both for the first time, but lost out on the league title to rivals Leeds United after leading the table for much of the season. </li>
      <li><strong>1993</strong> - After a slow start to the 1992–93 season by sitting 10th at the beginning of November, it looked as though United would miss out on the league title yet again. On 10 April 1993, United were second in the league when they faced Sheffield Wednesday at home. United were losing with four minutes to go before Steve Bruce equalised. After 7 minutes of injury time – which was subsequently dubbed “Fergie Time”, alluding to extra minutes allegedly being granted to Ferguson’s teams to get a goal – Bruce scored the 97th minute winner. This put United top of the league, where they remained. Winning the title ended United's 26-year wait for a league title, and also made them the first Premier League champions. </li>
      <li><strong>1994</strong> - The 1993–94 season brought more success. United led the 1993–94 Premier League table virtually from start to finish. Ferguson was the first winner of the Premier League Manager of the Month award, Manchester United achieved an impressive 4–0 scoreline against Chelsea, winning Ferguson his second League and Cup Double, following his Scottish Premier Division and Scottish Cup titles with Aberdeen in 1984–85. </li>
      <li><strong>1995</strong> -  1994–95 was a harder season for Ferguson. The championship slipped out of Manchester United's grasp as they drew 1–1 with West Ham United on the final day of the season, when a win would have given them a third successive league title. United also lost the FA Cup final in a 1–0 defeat by Everton.</li>
      <li><strong>1996</strong> - Ferguson was heavily criticised in the summer of 1995 when three of United's star players were allowed to leave and replacements were not bought. This season saw united reclaim their crown with a win against Middlesbrough on the final day sealed the title for United and the team beat Liverpool by a goal to nil to win the 1996 FA Cup Final; this was their second double in three years.</li>
      <li><strong>1997</strong> - United started the season by thrashing the previous year's league runners-up Newcastle 4-0 in the Charity Shield.  They went on to win their fourth league title in five seasons at the end of the 1996–97 campaign. Under Ferguson, the team made a better go in the Champions League and reached the semi-final stage for the first time in 28 years. </li>
    
    <li><strong>1998</strong> - United also began the season by wining the charity shield even with the departure of Cantona. United will fall short of the title by the end of the season, losing out to arsenal after an inspired second half of the season. </li>
    <li><strong>1999</strong> - United opened the 1998–99 season with a 3–0 loss to Arsenal in the 1998 FA Charity Shield. In the final weeks of the league season, Arsenal emerged as a creditable challenger to United. Both clubs were also paired together in the semi-final of the FA Cup, decided by a replay as the original game finished goalless. Keane was sent off in the second half and United conceded a penalty late into the match with the score 1–1. Dennis Bergkamp's effort was saved by Peter Schmeichel. Ferguson hoped his team "could at least take it to a penalty shoot-out", but instead the match was settled in extra time: Giggs ran the length of the pitch and evaded several Arsenal players to score the winning goal. United went on to beat Newcastle United in the FA Cup final and completed the double – a week earlier the team had regained the Premiership title. Beckham was positioned in centre midfield, while Giggs moved to the right wing and Blomqvist started on the left – changes the manager felt would prevent the opposition from playing narrow. United went on to complete the treble wining the UCL, EPL and FA Cup. In December 1999, the club beat Palmeiras in Tokyo to win the Intercontinental Cup</li>
      <li><strong>2000</strong> - United ended the 1999–2000 league season as champions, with just three defeats and a record points margin of 18. </li>
      <li><strong>2001</strong> - In the 2000–01 season, United retained the league title for a third season, becoming only the fourth side in history to do so.</li>
      <li><strong>2003</strong> - The 2002–03 season began rather poorly for United; the club made their worst start to a league campaign in 13 years.In a column for The Daily Telegraph, Hansen said Ferguson "will recognise this difficult start to the season for what it is: the greatest challenge of his career". Ferguson's response was typically bullish:
"I don't get paid to panic. We have had plenty of stuttering starts. My greatest challenge is not what's happening at the moment. My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their fucking perch. And you can print that." United's league form improved as the season went on despite defeat by Liverpool in the 2003 Football League Cup Final and they overhauled Arsenal to win the Premier League for an eighth time in May 2003.</li>
      <li><strong>2004</strong> -  In the 2003–04 season United finished third behind Arsenal's "Invincibles" and Chelsea.  United ended the campaign as FA Cup winners, beating Millwall 3–0 in the 2004 final</li> 
      <li><strong>2005</strong> - In the 2004-2005 season the club finish third for the third time in four seasons. In the 2004–05 FA Cup final, they lost on penalties.</li>
      <li><strong>2006</strong> - United finished the 2005- 2006 in second place in the league. Winning the League Cup was a consolation prize for lack of success elsewhere.</li>
      <li><strong>2007</strong> - Manchester United subsequently won their ninth Premier League title. In the Champions League, the club reached the semi-finals, recording a 7–1 home win over Roma in the quarter-final second leg.</li>
      <li><strong>2008</strong> - On 11 May 2008, Ferguson led Manchester United to a tenth Premier League title, exactly 25 years to the day after he led Aberdeen to European glory against Real Madrid in the Cup Winners' Cup. On 21 May 2008, Ferguson won his second European Cup with Manchester United as they beat Chelsea on penalties. Later in the year United became the first British club to win the FIFA Club World Cup.</li>
      <li><strong>2009</strong> - Although the team had a slow start to the 2008–09 season, United won the Premier League with a game to spare, making Ferguson the first manager in the history of English football to win the top division three times consecutively, on two separate occasions. Ferguson had now won 11 league titles at Manchester United, and the 2008–09 season title success put them level with Liverpool as league champions on a record 18 occasions in total. They also won the League Cup on penalties after a goalless draw in the final against Tottenham.</li>
      <li><strong>2010</strong> - In 2009–10 season, Ferguson added another League Cup to his honours list as United defeated Aston Villa 2–1 in the final on 28 February 2010, United's first ever successful knockout cup defence.</li>
      <li><strong>2011</strong> - Ferguson ended the following season by winning his 12th and Manchester United's 19th league title and thus overtaking Liverpool's record of 18.</li>
      <li><strong>2012</strong> - United managed to beat rivals Manchester City in the 2011 FA Community Shield and eliminated them in the FA Cup third round, but ended the season below City, who won their first Premier League title on goal differences lead.</li>
      <li><strong>2013</strong> - The 2012–13 season saw Ferguson guide United to become league champions for the 20th time, claiming the title with a 3–0 home win over Aston Villa on 22 April 2013 with four matches to spare.  His final game in charge, his 1,500th in total, saw United play out a 5–5 draw with West Bromwich Albion.</li>
